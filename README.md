# Create a Multi-Node Couchbase Deployment Locally in Three Easy Steps With GitOps

This repository is to support the Couchbase CONNECT 2021 talk: "Create a Multi-Node Couchbase Deployment Locally in Three Easy Steps With GitOps"

It includes all the examples of how to use KIND, Helm, the Couchbase Operator and the Couchbase SDK to spin up a local development cluster with a working example.

# Abstract

Wondering where to start with Couchbase development on Kubernetes? The days of using heavy infrastructure for development are gone.

This will show you how to quickly spin up a simple cluster locally using Kubernetes in Docker (KIND). Youâ€™ll see how to deploy the Couchbase Autonomous Operator using Helm to fully provision a working multi-node Couchbase cluster and then integrate this with an SDK, all in your local development environment.

This is just the beginning. You can apply the techniques you learn here to both interactive development and automated CI/CD pipelines.
